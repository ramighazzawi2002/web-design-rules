# Web Design Rules

## Project Description

This project aims to provide a comprehensive set of guidelines and best practices for web design. It covers various aspects of web design, including spacing, typography, layout, color usage, and web personality types. The goal is to help designers create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to offer a structured approach to web design, ensuring consistency and coherence across different web projects. By following these guidelines, designers can create websites that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional.

## Usage

To use these guidelines, refer to the sections below for specific recommendations on spacing, typography, layout, color usage, and web personality types. Apply these principles to your web design projects to achieve a professional and polished look.

## Spacing System

The spacing system provides a set of predefined values for properties related to spacing, such as margin, padding, width, height, positioning, and gap (for flexbox and grid).

### Spacing Values (px)

2 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96 / 128

## Font Size System

The font size system provides a set of predefined values specifically for the font-size property.

### Font Size Values (px)

10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 24 / 30 / 36 / 44 / 52 / 62 / 74 / 86 / 98

## Color Guidelines

- Main Color: #087f5b
- Grey Color: #343a40

## Typography Guidelines

1. Font bold and size:
   - Normal text: 16 - 32 px
   - Long text: 20px or even bigger
   - Headline: 50px +, bold 600+
   - Any text: don't use font-weight under 400 (regular)

2. Use less than 75 characters per line.

3. Normal-sized text use line-height between 1.5 - 2. Big text go below 1.5.

4. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience).

5. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing.

6. Don't justify text.

7. Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine.

8. Colors:
   - Make the main color match your website personality.
   - Select main and accent and grey colors using multiple tools.
   - On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background ("lighter version") for text.
   - The text (not heading) should usually not be completely black. Lighten it up if it looks heavy and uninviting.
   - Don't make text too light for accessibility. Use tools like Coolors to check contrast between text and background colors. Normal contrast at least 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18px+).
   - OpenColors is best for color selection.
   - Coolors is best for color contrast.

## Layout and Design Principles

1. Use a lot of whitespace.
2. Use whitespace to group elements.
3. Match other design choices. If you have big text or big icons, use more whitespace.
4. Add a lot of whitespace between sections.
5. Make every topic in a section clear by using whitespace.
